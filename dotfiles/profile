# According to:
# http://superuser.com/questions/789448/choosing-between-bashrc-profile-bash-profile-etc
#
#   * ~/.profile has the stuff NOT specifically related to bash, such as
#     environment variables (PATH and friends)
#   * Anything that should be available to graphical applications OR to sh (or
#     bash invoked as sh) MUST be in ~/.profile
#   * Anything that should be available only to login shells should go in
#     ~/.profile
#
# This file must be compatible with non-bash things, like other shells and
# other non-shell programs that check it for settings.

#
# Include private defs (not in main file cuz this one's in my public github).
#
